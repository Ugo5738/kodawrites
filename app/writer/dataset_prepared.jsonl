It's not clear whether the complete Tool catalog will appear on streaming, but major releases like \"Opiate,\" \"Undertow,\" \"AEnima,\" \"Lateralus,\" and \"10,000 Days\" are confirmed.\nTool has been a conspicuous gap on streaming platforms, absent even as artists like The Beatles and Pink Floyd have conceded to demand. While rights may be an obstacle, famous bands have more often been hesitant to divert sales from downloads and physical copies, which pay far better. Even the most popular artists on streaming services often depend on touring and merchandise to actually make a living.\nStreaming is easily the most popular source of paid music in the U.S. however, making it essential for exposure.\n\n\nEND"}

At the same time, Intel announced it was abandoning work on 5G phone modems.\nIntel's phone modem business has been losing about $1 billion per year, one source said.\nApple is believed to be developing its own 5G modem under senior hardware VP Johny Srouji, with an expected 2022 premiere. In the interim the company will likely use Qualcomm parts, since they're already in shipping 5G devices.\nBuying out Intel talent and concepts could accelerate first-party development, though whether that would be enough to get a chip out in 2021 is unknown.

The Commission accuses Qualcomm of selling UMTS baseband chips to two customers below cost in a bid to force Icera out of the market.\nThe alleged activity took place between 2009 and 2011. Nvidia announced a $367 million takeover deal in May 2011, but ultimately decided to kill off Icera in 2015.\nThe prior Commission fine was issued over Qualcomm's multi-year exclusivity deal with Apple, which prevented companies like Intel from joining the iPhone modem supply chain. Intel did eventually start supplying chips with 2016's iPhone 7, but said it would exit the 5G modem business earlier this year, clearing the way for Qualcomm to rejoin the chain following a protracted legal war.\n\n\nEND"}

As necessary they can jump to the times a keyword was said and share timestamped links with others.\nSession videos are accessible to everyone, regardless of whether they're registered as an Apple developer. Some topics this year included accessibility, SwiftUI, Core ML 3 and more.\nSecuring a spot at WWDC can be difficult as demand normally outweighs room. Every year the company holds a lottery for the right to buy tickets, which in 2019 cost $1,599 apiece before any travel expenses. The benefit though is direct access to Apple experts, the ability to socialize with fellow developers, and in some cases the chance to try new hardware and software before anyone else.\n\n\nEND"}

June rumors claimed that Apple was looking to buy a part of Intel's mobile modem business, specifically core German operations.\nIntel announced it was exiting the 5G modem business almost immediately after Apple and Qualcomm settled a long-running legal battle. As part of the settlement, Qualcomm will be supplying modems to Apple, and is expected to start with the 2020 iPhone models.\n\n\nEND"}

The 4-terabyte option previously cost $2,800, more than many whole systems.\nWith the MacBook Air, Apple has removed a 1.5-terabyte configuration, narrowing selections to 256 gigabytes, 512 gigabytes, and 1 terabyte. The latter two choices are $200 and $400.\nSimilar price cuts have reached the iMac, iMac Pro, and Mac mini. On a 27-inch iMac for example, 256-gigabyte, 512-gigabyte, and 1-terabyte options are $100, $300, and $500.\nApple has often been criticized as overpricing SSD upgrades beyond what they cost from third-party vendors, especially versus equivalents on Windows PCs.\n\n\nEND"}

In reality the App Store premiered in July 2008, for which \"Texas Hold'em\" was upgraded and released as one of the first 500 titles. The game's last update â€” version 1.1 â€” dates back to Aug. 31 that year.\nIts new incarnation includes overhauled graphics and characters, 10 backdrops, and the ability to duel up to 8 other people over Wi-Fi. Players can also switch between first-person and top-down views.\nThe changes mean that while \"Texas Hold'em\" is still a free download, it's now sized over 1.5 gigabytes, and requires an iPhone or iPod with iOS 12 or later.\nWhile Apple is not known for releasing games under its name via the App Store, it is the second such launch from the iPhone maker this year.

It's uncertain when the change might make it into Google's Chrome OS, but since it should require modifying the software's Linux kernel an update is unlikely to be imminent, according to About Chromebooks.\nChrome OS already supports USB connections to Android phones. Currently, Chrome OS devices would have to connect to an iPhone by turning the latter into a personal hotspot.\nWhile this does the job of sharing the iPhone's data connection with other devices, creating a Wi-Fi hotspot does consume battery power at a higher rate on the iPhone. A wired connection would use less power, and depending on the connected device, could even recharge the iPhone as part of the process.\nGoogle regularly extend apps, features, and services to Apple platforms, despite nominally competing.

Samsung (Tizen), Google (Android TV\/Chromecast), Amazon (Fire TV), and Nintendo followed suit.\nThe reason for Apple's performance is uncertain, but an Apple TV 4K is one of the more expensive add-on options, starting at $179.

That may suggest that the latter colors are the least popular, if Apple isn't simply switching things up to make 2019 hardware distinct.\nThe images appear to show broken pieces of several phone shells, as hinted by rounded edges. Also seen are black, white, and yellow shards. It's unclear where they were sourced from or if they're authentic.\nThe iPhone XR is also presently available in black, white, yellow, and (PRODUCT)RED, the last of which shares proceeds with charity.

The Watch must be on its charger and have at least 50 percent power.\nAt that point people can launch the \"Watch\" app in iOS, then navigate to Software Update under the General menu. From there an iPhone can fetch and install 5.2.1, a process which could take as long as an hour.\nApple went through multiple developer builds prior to today's release.

That's in part because it uses a 1,792-by-828-pixel LCD, whereas the XS line's OLED panels start at 2,436-by-1,125.\nThe XR is widely believed to be the bestselling 2018 iPhone model, allegedly outselling any other smartphone in North America during the March quarter.

Voice commands can be especially important for AR and VR headsets, since they're typically not used in combination with a keyboard, mouse, or touchscreen.\nPortal is actually the company's video call hardware. Adding a voice assistant would naturally turn it into a video-capable smartspeaker akin to the Google Home Hub or Amazon Echo Show.\nThe assistant was first exposed earlier today by CNBC, which said that it's being crafted by a Redmond, Wash., team typically assigned to long-term projects. Development began in early 2018, and Facebook has allegedly been contacting vendors in the smartspeaker supply chain, perhaps pointing to a dedicated product.\n\n\nEND"}

The device is not yet in the hands of customers, but presumably, the first batch scheduled to be shipped to early pre-orderers before the end of the month are already packaged and ready to go.\nThe Galaxy Fold isn't the world's first foldable smartphone, but it is the first from a major vendor, designed to attract rich shoppers who want to be on the cutting edge.\nIf Samsung is forced to do a recall, the results will likely be less disastrous than the one for the fire-prone Galaxy Note 7, which cost the company some $5 billion. While the Fold is priced at nearly $2,000, there are likely far fewer in circulation.\nUpdate: Samsung responded to the issue in a statement to The Verge, saying, \"A limited number of early Galaxy Fold samples were provided to media for review. We have received a few reports regarding the main display on the samples provided. We will thoroughly inspect these units in person to determine the cause of the matter.\"\n\n\nEND"}

Earlier rumors pointed to a group led by China Silkroad Investment Capital.\nThe rest of the money will come through preferred shares to refinance existing debt, held by the existing largest shareholder, INCJ. That firm is backed by the Japanese government.\nJapan Display has needed multiple cash infusions in the past, including ones in 2016 and 2018, the latter to secure orders for the iPhone XR.

Reasons claimed are to keep costs down, as well as to prevent antagonizing customers and manufacturers with a shift to the newer connection method.\nThe information was obtained from a series of manufacturers who told the publication that the older Lightning would be retained.\nFor comparison's sake, the 30-pin connector was introduced on the third generation iPod in 2003, and ran for nine years until it was replaced in 2012. A shift to USB-C in the 2019 iPhone means that it would only be seven years between connector replacement.\nThe spec for USB-C was initially submitted in 2012, and published in early 2014. Apple's first product to incorporate the connector was the Retina MacBook, rolled out on April 10, 2015.\n\n\nEND"}

The last one is notable in that Apple rarely promotes country music outside the boundaries of Apple Music and iTunes, and even there to a lesser extent than pop, rap, hip-hop, or R&B.\nAll three acts are current or previous Grammy nominees. Earlier this month Apple debuted billboards specifically based around this year's crop, erecting them in Los Angeles, where the Grammy ceremony is taking place.\nMemojis â€” customizable animojis â€” have become a common touchpoint in Apple's marketing, something immediately identifiable with its products.

USB interfaces have been the most commonly impacted, but trouble may manifest to a lesser extent with Thunderbolt hardware.\nApple is reportedly aware of the glitch, as are manufacturers like RME, which have linked the problem to macOS. The cause could have something to do with macOS' system time daemon, \"timed,\" as some people have reported success by unloading it. The daemon returns once a Mac is rebooted, however.\nFor audio professionals the issue may make a Mac difficult to use in recording, and simply unusable for live performances.

Items in the iCloud Keychain are immune, Henze told Heise.\nThere have been no reports so far of the exploit being used in the wild, but concerned Mac owners can protect themselves by adding an extra password to the login keychain.\nHenze's protest stems from the fact that the company's bug bounty program only covers iOS, not macOS.

In that case the ad the points out that the singer is an \"Album of the Year\" nominee.\nWhile Apple regularly runs billboard campaigns, it's rare for the company to target specific events.

When jumping into Music from Control Center there is also a new animation.\nFrom the lockscreen, the date has now been replaced by the battery capacity â€” a move that will certainly be controversial.

Though his dog helped keep him warm, Felix began to worry that he wouldn't survive the night â€” Pahrump is a desert town, and temperatures can get dangerously cold during winter nights.\nHe then realized he could make a call through Siri, and tried several contacts.

You may need to tap \"Mailboxes\" in the upper-left part of the screen if you're sitting in the Inbox view.\nYou'll now see a \"VIP\" section available. Tap on it, and you should see an \"Add VIP\" option. A note for later: once you've added VIPs, you'll want to tap on the \"i\" (info) button here to see your VIP List and make changes.\nEither way, selecting Add VIP will bring up your contacts, from which you can tap on an entry to add a person. If a contact is grayed out, that means that they don't have an email address Mail can use, in which case you'll have to load up Contacts outside of Mail and make edits.\nOnce you've added everyone you want, all you have to do in the future is go to the Mailboxes view and tap VIP to see a filtered inbox.\n\n\nEND"}

People who used the in-app option earlier will continue to be billed through iTunes, but once service is canceled for at least a month, they'll be forced to resubscribe on the Web and then log back into the iOS app.\nThe change was presumably made to avoid Apple's cut of in-app transactions. Apple normally takes 30 percent â€” this can shrink to 15 percent for long-term subscribers, but still means that subscription services must either lose a substantial amount of profit or increase their App Store pricing, which risks alienating customers.\nOne of the best-known examples of this problem was faced by Spotify, which for some time charged in-app Premium subscribers $3 extra. It eventually soured on the discrepancy and abandoned the in-app option.\n\n\nEND"}

It's an edge-to-edge LCD measuring 6.1 inches, with a pixel resolution of 1,792 by 828. That contrasts with the iPhone XS â€” which has a 5.8-inch OLED panel with 2,436-by-1,125 resolution â€” and the XS Max, which bumps screen size to 6.5 inches and resolution to 2,688 by 1,242.\n\n\nEND"}

According to CDC estimates, Afib can affect up to two percent of the younger population of the United States, rising to nine percent for those 65 years or older.\n\n\nEND"}

Its worth is estimated at $10,000 or more, as the premiere issue of Macworld is hard to find â€” much less one signed by Jobs, who famously provided few fan autographs in his lifetime.\nMaking the auction even more unusual is video and photographic proof of Jobs signing the magazine, on top of certification from outside authentication services.\nA related item going up for bid is a Jobs business card dating back to when Apple was based at 20525 Mariani Avenue in Cupertino, across from 1 Infinite Loop. The company's current headquarters is 1 Apple Park, elsewhere in the city.\nThe card's worth is estimated at much less than the magazine, around $500. Both auctions will close on Dec. 13.\n\n\nEND"}

Buyers will, however, have to supply their own charging cable. There are also various international editions, such as the British one, which sports a unique folding prong mechanism.\nThe adapter is the same one bundled with 2018 iPad Pros. The ability to buy the product separately has been an ongoing demand, especially given the growing standardization of USB-C in and outside of the Apple ecosystem. For people already invested in the technology, it may allow them to reduce cable clutter or swap in a substitute cable as needed.\niPhones supporting fast charging include the 8, 8 Plus, X, XS, XS Max, and XR.\n\n\nEND"}

It is currently unknown what categories each outlet will be revealing.\nThe nominee announcements are occurring later than originally planned, due to clashing with the scheduled memorial services for former President George H.W.

Multiple Onelink alarms can trigger each other through a Bluetooth mesh network.\nHomeKit compatibility allows notifications through Apple's Home app, and the option of creating special emergency automations. In the case of a fire, for example, a Onelink could automatically open smartlocks, turn on lights, and disengage a furnace.\nThe Smart Smoke + Carbon Monoxide Alarm lacks some of the features of First Alert's more costly Safe & Sound. The latter has a better speaker, which can play music, take Alexa voice commands, and will eventually get AirPlay 2 support for HomeKit audio integration.\n\n\nEND"}

Shoppers can use Apple Pay in the Target iOS app, but at retail the closest equivalent is a scannable barcode in the app.\nThe Twitter anecdotes were first highlighted by 9to5Mac.\nIt is possible that the Metreon store has simply enabled NFC by accident, but merchants will often test Apple Pay on a small scale before official rollouts. Target has also been under public pressure to support the platform, given the popularity of the iPhone and Apple Watch in the U.S.\n\n\nEND"}

All of the apps are said to have violated App Store rules blocking companies from installing updates without delivering them through Apple's service.\nApple has been taking a hard stance on those rules for almost two years, so it's not clear what prompted the latest action. State media has however put pressure on Apple to control the App Store, and the government has periodically asked the company to censor apps such as VPN clients and The New York Times in order to smash dissent.\nIn August Apple culled some 25,000 Chinese apps, including about 4,000 related to gambling, which aren't permitted in that market.\n\n\nEND"}
